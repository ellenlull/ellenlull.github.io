# Project Description
The goal of this project was to analyze data on 2410 craft beers created in 558 breweries across the United # States to determine any additional  opportunities for Budweiser.  Data collected included alcohol by Volume  (ABV), International Bitterness Units (IBU) and the Style  of each craft beer.  
##------
##  Load needed libraries 
##  Read Spreadsheets:  Breweries and Beers
##		
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(caret)
library(class)

breweries <- read.delim("C:/School Stuff/DS/Doing DS/Project1/breweries.csv",header=TRUE,sep=",")

beer <- read.delim("C:/School Stuff/DS/Doing DS/Project1/beers.csv",header=TRUE,sep=",")
```
## Question #1  
###  Graph to show how many breweries per state
 
```{r}
breweries %>% ggplot(aes(x = State,fill=State )) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  ggtitle("Count of Breweries by State") + ylab("Count of Breweries")+    theme(legend.position="none")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+ theme(plot.title = element_text(size=22))

```
   
#### Question #2 

Merge Beer and Brewery datasets and show first 6 and last 6 Rows.   Note that this is repeated after the data is cleansed to handle missing values

   
```{r}
brewbeer <- merge(beer,breweries,by.x="Brewery_id", by.y = "Brew_ID")
 
head(brewbeer,6)
tail(brewbeer,6)

```
#### Question #3 

This will impute values for missing IBU Values  This was done by calculating and averaging the Alpha Acid * Boil Time by Beer Style  and imputing IBU Values based on this average  ABT was averaged by Style

```{r}
IBUTrain = filter(beer,(!is.na(beer$IBU)))

IBUTrain$AABT  <-  (IBUTrain$IBU*7.25)/IBUTrain$Ounces

###this gives us mean AABT by style
AABTMEAN <-IBUTrain %>% group_by(Style) %>% summarise( meanAABT = mean(AABT))


#merge the blank with AABT avgs table by style
Beerwithaabt  <-merge(beer,AABTMEAN,by="Style",all.x=TRUE)

##calculate the IBU based off style avg of AABT

Beerwithaabt$AVG_IBU <- (Beerwithaabt$Ounces*Beerwithaabt$meanAABT)/7.25
```
The following will calculate an average ABV by Style to use for missing values.
```{r}

ABVTrain = filter(beer,(!is.na(beer$ABV)))
ABVbyStyle <- as.data.frame(ABVTrain %>% group_by(Style) %>% summarise(meanABV = mean(ABV)))
beerwavgs <- merge(Beerwithaabt,ABVbyStyle, by = "Style",all.x = TRUE)
```
Add in the Derived ABV and IBU values and omit any rows where IBU could not be calculated because there  was no training data.  In other words, there were no rows with valid IBU data for that particular style of beer

Calculate drvIBU and drvABV fields in final Beer dataset so that we have a value for ABV and IBU to use for all rows
```{r}

beerfnl1 <- mutate(beerwavgs,drvIBU=ifelse(is.na(IBU),AVG_IBU,IBU))
beerfnl <- mutate(beerfnl1,drvABV=ifelse(is.na(ABV),meanABV,ABV))

#omit remaining null averaged IBU because there was no data to train on.  Mostly Cider
beerfnl2 <- filter(beerfnl,!is.na(drvIBU))
```
 
Merge with Breweries.   Get rid of Missing Style.
```{r}
brewdata <- filter(merge(beerfnl2,breweries,by.x="Brewery_id", by.y = "Brew_ID"),!is.na(Style))

```
####  Question 4, 5 6 and 7
####  Graphs to show ABV and IBU by state and relationships between ABV and IBU

```{r}
### Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare.
brewdata2 <- as.data.frame(brewdata %>% group_by(State) %>% summarise(medibu = mean(drvIBU)))
brewdata3 <- as.data.frame(brewdata %>% group_by(State) %>% summarise(medabv = mean(drvABV)))
brewdata4 <- merge(brewdata2,brewdata3,by="State",all.x=TRUE)


  
###  Question 4   
###  Graph median IBU and  Median ABV by state
  
brewdata4 %>% ggplot(aes(x = State, y = medibu, fill=State)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", ) + 
  ggtitle("Median IBU by State") + 
  xlab ("State") +
  ylab ("International Bitterness Units") +
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+ theme(plot.title = element_text(size=22))


brewdata4 %>% ggplot(aes(x = State, y = medabv, fill=State)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", ) + 
    ggtitle("Median ABV by State") + 
    xlab ("State") +
    ylab ("Alcohol by Volume") +
    theme(legend.position="none")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+ theme(plot.title = element_text(size=22))
  
###  Question  5  
###  Highest IBU in Breweries: #1: Delaware - 67 1 brewery that makes 2 beer types have the highest IBU, followed by West Virginia (57.5)   
###  West Virginia has 1 brewery that makes 2 beer types and Delaware has two breweries that produces 1 beer type each
### Breweries in NV (.0662) and DC (.0656) have the highest alcohol content    DC has only one brewery, and NV has 2 breweries.    
  


####  Scaled IBU and ABV - not really used #####

brewdata4$scaledibu = scale(brewdata4$medibu,center=FALSE, scale=TRUE)
brewdata4$scaledabv = scale(brewdata4$medabv,center=FALSE, scale=TRUE)

### Make ABV Factors to graph ABV and IBU on same plot

brewdata4$abv_factor = cut(brewdata4$medabv, breaks = c(.05,.057,.059,.062,.069), labels = c("< .057",".057 to .059", ".059 to .062","Above .062"))

brewdata4 %>% ggplot(aes(x = State, y = scaledibu, fill=factor(abv_factor))) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity",position="jitter" ) + 
    ggtitle("Median IBU by State and ABV") + 
    xlab ("State") +
    ylab ("IBU") 
###  Question 6  Distribution of ABV
###  Regardless of style, most beers have an Alcohol by Volume between 4.9% and 5.9%.
###  We believe that consumers are more likely concerned with bitterness (IBU) of beer rather than the Alcohol Content as evidenced by the distribution below.

  
###   Question 7
####   Scatterplot showing relationship between ABV and IBU.  
####
 

brewdata %>%  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = drvABV, y = drvIBU)) + 
     geom_point(position = "jitter",col="Blue") +
     ggtitle("Derived ABV by Derived IBU") + 
    xlab ("Alcohol By Volume") +
    ylab ("International Bittering Units") 


brewdata %>%  ggplot(aes(x = ABV)) + geom_histogram(color='black',fill='darkslategray3') + ggtitle("Histogram of ABV")
```
#####   Question 8
Create a varaible named Type.  Narrow our analysis to IPA and ALE.   We will be creating a reduced dataset called "final" for this analysis      The point of this exercise is to show that stat difference exist between IPA and Ale, so we can use KNN to classify a beer as Ale or IPA. We have confidence in KNN because of the results of the confusionmatrix. 

```{r}
final <-brewdata %>% filter(grepl("IPA|India Pale Ale|\\bAle\\b",brewdata$Style))
final$TYPE <-ifelse(str_detect(final$Style,"IPA|India Pale Ale"),"IPA","Ale")
final$TYPE <-as.factor(final$TYPE)

#cleaning up dataframe
final<-data.frame(Brewery_id =final$Brewery_id, Beer_name = final$Name.x, Beer_ID = final$Beer_ID, Ounces = final$Ounces, drvIBU = final$drvIBU,
                  drvABV = final$drvABV, Brewery_name = final$Name.y, City = final$City, State = final$State, Style = final$Style, Type = final$TYPE)
final <-na.omit(final)                  
#graph of Type of Beers..IPA VS ALE
final %>% ggplot(mapping =aes (x= scale(drvIBU), y= scale(drvABV),col= Type)) +
  geom_point(position='jitter') +
  ggtitle("Derived ABV by IBU and Beer Type (Ale or IPA)") +
  xlab ("Derived IBU") +
  ylab ("Derived ABV") +
  geom_smooth(method='lm')+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+ theme(plot.title = element_text(size=22))

# Create Train and Test set for KNN in order to classify beer as IPA or ALE

splitPerc = .7
trainfinal = sample(1:dim(final)[1],round(splitPerc * dim(final)[1]))
train = final[trainfinal,]
test = final[-trainfinal,]


classifications = knn(train[,c(5,6)],test[,c(5,6)],train$Type,prob = TRUE, k =20)
confusionMatrix(test$Type,classifications)


#filter out the data in order to perform Ttest on the Ale & IPA mean to show they are different. The results of the ttest show IPA & ABV have different profiles for IBV & ABV
#this gives us more confidence in using KNN to classify a beer as ALE or IPA because there is a stat difference between the beers. 
Ale <- final %>% filter(Type == "Ale")
IPA <- final %>% filter(Type =="IPA")

t.test(x=Ale$drvIBU,y=IPA$drvIBU)
t.test(x=Ale$drvABV,y=IPA$drvABV)

###  An ordinary linear regresssion and the graph above show that there is a significant interaction between ABV and IBU when determining the Type of beer to be Ale or IPA
final$type1 = ifelse(final$Type=='Ale',1,0)
ols <- lm(final$type1 ~ final$drvIBU + final$drvABV + final$drvABV:final$drvIBU)
summary(ols)
```

#### Question 9 
Since there more Ale beers within the dataset, we believe that consumers have a higher demand for Ale beer than an IPA. Perhaps majority of consumers consider IPA to be to bitter. We have identified the Ale beer market as an area to enter.  Budweiser should create an Ale beer with the median ABV and IBU profile of Ale beer.  They should only enter states that have ale breweries between 26 and 12. This range provides them the opportunity to gain a market share of a growing taste preference for Ale Beer. If Budweiser enter a state outside of this range, then they may not be competitive due to oversaturated or lack of interest from consumers. Further analysis of state to state migration needs to be done for states with lower number of breweries. 
```{r}
#overall summary of Ale vs Beer
###  Graph of current Ale beers by location with ABV < .06
####
filter(final,drvABV < .06 ) %>% ggplot(aes(x = State,  fill=Type)) +
geom_bar(stat = "count",position='stack' ) +
ggtitle("Number of Beers by State with ABV < .06") +
xlab ("State") +
ylab ("Count of Beers Produced with ABV < .06")

#graph of Ale breweries in USA

Aledata = Ale %>%  group_by(State) %>% summarise(counts = n())
Aledata %>%ggplot(aes(x =reorder(State, -counts), y = counts)) +geom_bar(stat = "identity",fill="darkred")+ggtitle("Count of Ale Breweries by State") + ylab("Count of Breweries")+xlab("States")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```
